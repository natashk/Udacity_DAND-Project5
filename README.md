## Project 5: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

In this project, I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect). I used some data collected from others who have performed the the task and computed some statistics describing the results. Finally, I interpreted the results in terms of my hypotheses.
